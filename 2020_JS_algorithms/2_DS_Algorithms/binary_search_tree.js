// Linked Lists, Trees, and Graphs are structures with nodes that keep references to other nodes.

// In terms of complexity, Stacks and Queues are the simplest and can be constructed from Linked Lists.
// Trees and Graphs are the most complex because they extend the concept of a linked list.

// When we think of a binary search tree, the three things we should think of are:

// Root: This is the very top node of a tree structure and does not have a parent
// Parent: It is a child of a node but also the parent of a node
// Child: This node is the child of a node and does not necessarily have a child

// In a binary search tree, each node either has zero, one, or two children.
// The child on the left is called the left child, and the child on the right is the right child.
// In a binary search tree, the child on the left must be smaller than the child on the right.
