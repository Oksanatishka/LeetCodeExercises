Methods to remove elements from JavaScript arrays:
    pop() - Removes from the End of an Array
    shift() - Removes from the beginning of an Array
    splice(indexOfLocationInArr, numberOfElemToRemove) - removes from a specific Array index
    filter - allows you to programatically remove elements from an Array, filter() does not mutate the array on which it is called, but returns a new array. filter() has a single parameter, a callback method.
    
Methods to add elements to JavaScript arrays:
    push() - add one or more elements to the end of an array.
    concat() - adds elements to an array. Unlike the push method, it does not modify the existing array, but instead returns a new array.
    unshift() - add elements to the beginning of an array.
    splice(location, numberOfElemToDelete, ElemToAdd) - adding and/or removing elements from an array, numberOfElemToDelete = 0
