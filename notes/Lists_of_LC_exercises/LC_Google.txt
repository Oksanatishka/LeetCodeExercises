Arrays and Strings
>   Longest Substring with At Most K Distinct Characters
        Google likes to test your ability to think at large scale by asking variation of problems represented in a 
        'data stream model'. For example, instead of giving you an integer array, you are given a stream of integers 
        and all integers are too large to fit in memory. A great example of such problem, which can be represented 
        in a data stream model, is the Longest Substring with At Most K Distinct Characters.

Recursion   // Recursion usually involves some kind of backtracking to enumerate all possibilities. Note that Recursion is a more general purpose algorithm. DFS is a specific form of backtracking related to searching tree DSs. Therefore we categorize those problems in "Trees and Graphs", even though they involve recursion.
